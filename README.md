# Going Micro to Go Negative


Spreading uncivil negative campaign messages are a "high-risk, high reward" campaign strategy.
While certain voters may be more swayed by such negative messaging (*negativity bias*) other voters may be more inclined to feel sympathy with the attacked.
At the same time advertising platforms boast of their ability to deliver ads to targeted audiences and political campaigns are increasingly making use of this microtargeting capability to spread both positive and negative messages through these platforms. 
Uncivil negative ads in particular may be optimized to narrowly target citizen because such ads are likely to appeal to only a particular subset of voters.
Campaigns too may try to optimize their targeting towards narrower audiences or outsource their uncivil ads to outside groups.
To study whether such optimizations are taking place, we retrieve all online advertisements of the 2020 US election that were placed on Facebook platforms (incl. Instagram) in the period of at least three months before the election (August 3rd - November 3rd 2020). 
We perform logistic regression and find that ads with a narrower audience are not more likely to be uncivil than ads targeted at a broader audience which is counter to our expectations. 
We further find that ads from outside groups (like super PACs, non profits, and corporations) are more uncivil on average. The study presented in this paper contributes to the literature by being one of the first studies to investigate how political incivility could be targeted towards citizens via the ad delivery systems afforded by social media platforms.
